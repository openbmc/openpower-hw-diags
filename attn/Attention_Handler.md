# Introduction
An attention is a hardware, firmware or software alert mechanism used to request service from an Attention Handler via an attention signal (e.g. a GPIO). An attention handler is, in this case, a stateless service that handles attention requests. The attention handler in combination with a hardware analyzer constitutes the Openpower Hardware Diagnostics (hardware diags) component. Hardware diags can operate in daemon mode and in application mode. When operating in daemon mode openpower hardware diags may be referred to as the attention handler or attention handler service. When operating in application mode openpower hardware diags may be referred to as the analyzer. Both modes executing simultaneously is supported however. There can be at most one instance of the attention handler service, per attention signal.

# Overview
The main role of the attention handler is a long running process monitoring the attention interrupt signal and delegating tasks to external components to aid in handling attention requests. The attention handler is loaded into memory when the host is started and monitors the attention signal until the host is stopped. When an attention (signal) is detected by the attention handler (monitor) the attention handler will query the state of the host to determine the nature of the active attention(s).

The attention handler services four types of attentions namely, and in order of priority, Vital Attention (vital), Terminate Immediately (TI), Breakpoint Attention (BP) and Checkstop Attention (checkstop). TI and BP attentions are categorically called Special Attentions (special) and are mutually exclusive. Additionally a TI can be raised by either hostboot (HBTI) or the hypervisor (PHYPTI).

The general handling of attentions is as follows:
- vital: log an event, request a hardware dump and request a re-ipl of the host.
- PHYPTI: log an event and request a memory preserving IPL (MPIPL) of the host.
- HBTI: log an event, request a hostboot dump and request a re-ipl of the host.
- BP: notify the debug agent (e.g. Cronus)
- checkstop: log an event, call the analyzer, request a system dump and request a re-ipl of the host. 

# Implementation Details
## External Components
The attention handler relies on several external components and BMC services for the handling of attentions. Among these are systemd, dbus, phosphor-logging and PDBG.

The general use of these components are as follows:
- systemd: loading and unloading of the attention handler service.
- dbus: querying the state of the BMC and host, requesting dumps and requesting host IPL's
- phosphor-logging: debug tracing and logging platform events.
- PDBG: querying host hardware.

## Component Usage
- Platform Event Log (PEL) entry creation and debug tracing: phosphor-logging component.
- Host Transition (re-IPL, MPIPL request): dbus interface.
- Attention handler starting and stopping: systemd. 

## Starting and Stopping
The attention handler service is started via the BMC systemd infrastructure when the host is started. When the attention handler is started it will register itself as the GPIO event handler associated with the attention GPIO and remain resident in memory waiting for attentions. The attention handler will be stopped via the BMC systemd infrastructure when the host is stopped.

If the attention handler terminates due to an error condition it will automatically be restarted by systemd. The attention handler restart policy is based on the BMC default restart policy (n-number of restarts in n-seconds maximum).

## Attentions
When the attention signal becomes active the attention handler will begin handling attentions. Using the PDBG interface the attention handler will query the host to determine the reason for the active attention handler signal.  Each enabled processor will be queried and a map of active attentions will be created. The first attention of highest priority will be the one that is serviced (see Overview for attention type and priority). The Global Interrupt Status Register in combination with an associated attention mask register is used to determine active attentions.

### Vital Attention
A vital attention is handled by generating an event log via the phosphor-logging inteface and then using the dump manager dbus interface to request a hardware dump. The attention handler will wait, up to one hour, for the dump to complete and then use the systemd interface to request a re-IPL of the host. This type of attention indiactes that there was aproblem with the Self Boot Engine (SBE) hardware.

### Special Attentions
Three types of attentions, HBTI, PHYPTI and BP, share a single attention status flag (special attention) in the global interrupt status register. In order to determine the specific type of special attention the attention handler relies on a portion of shared memory called the Shared TI Information Data Area (TI info). The attention handler gains access to this memory region by submitting a request for its memory address through the PDBG interface. The request is via a Chip Operation (chipop) command. 

#### HBTI
These attention types are indications from hostboot that an error has occurred or a shutdown has been requested. When servicing a HBTI the attention handler will consider two cases namely a TI with SRC and a TI with EID.

For a TI with SRC, using the TI info,  the attention handler will create and submit a PEL entry on behalf of hostboot, request a hostboot dump and upon completion, or timeout, request a re-IPL of the host using the dbus interface. Optionally, based upon flags in the TI info, the attention handler may mark the PEL entry as hidden.

For a TI with EID, the attention handler will, based upon flags in the TI info, request a hostboot dump using the dbus interface. Upon completion, or timeout, of the dump the attention handler will request a re-IPL of the host via the dbus interface. For a TI with EID the attention handler will forgo creating a PEL entry (hostboot has already done this).

#### PHYPTI
These attentions are indications from the hypervisor that an error has occurred. When servicing a PHYPTI the attention handler will generate a PEL entry and then request a host MPIPL using the PDBG interface (chipop).

#### BP (breakpoint)
These attentions are used to signal to the attention handler that it should notify the debug agent (e.g. Cronus) that a debug breakpoint has been encountered. If the TI info data is considered valid and neither a HBTI or PHYPTI is determined to be the cause of the special attention than a BP attention is assumed. When a BP attention occurs the attention handler will use the dbus interface to notify the debug agent that a breakpoint condition was encountered. The attention handler will then go back to listening for attentions.

#### Recoverables
These attentions are indications that recoverable errors have been encountered. These attentions do not generate an attention GPIO event however when servicing a TI the attention handler will note whether or not the host is reporting recoverable errors. If recoverable errors are present the attention handler will call the analyzer before requesting a dump or IPL. The check for recoverable errors is done using the PDBG interface (the Global Interrupt Status Register).

### Checkstop
These attentions indicate that a hardware error has occurred and further hardware analyses is required to determine root cause. When servicing a checkstop attention the attention handler will call the analyzer and then wait for analyses to complete. Once analysis has completed the attention handler will use the dbus interface to request a system dump and upon completetion, or timeout, will request a re-IPL of the host.

## Configuration
Some attention handler behavior can be configured by passing parameters to the service using the service file or using the command line. Currently the following behaviors are configurable:
- vital handling enable/disable, default enable
- TI handling enable/disable, default enable
- BP handling enable/disable, default enable
- checkstop handling enable/disable, default enable
- special attention default BP/TI, default BP

## Additional Considerations
Regardless of the type of special attention the attention handler will always create at least one PEL entry containing attention handler specific FFDC. In some cases this entry may be informational.

Regardless of the type of attention, after servicing the attention the attention handler will return to listening for attentions. In most cases no more attentions will be detected unless the currently active attentions are cleared. Normally active attentions will be cleared by the host re-IPL but any component could clear the active attentions as is the case for BP attentions and the debug agent.

If the attention handler encounters any errors while servicing an interrupt it will generate a PEL entry to indicate the error that was encountered.
