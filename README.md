# Hardware Diagnostics for POWER Systems

In the event of a system fatal error reported by the internal system hardware
(processor chips, memory chips, I/O chips, system memory, etc.), POWER Systems
have the ability to diagnose the root cause of the failure and perform any
service action needed to avoid repeated system failures.

Aditional details TBD.

## Building

For a standard OpenBMC release build, you want something like:

```
meson -Dtests=disabled <build_dir>
ninja -C <build_dir>
ninja -C <build_dir> install
```

For a test / debug build, a typical configuration is:

```
meson -Dtests=enabled <build_dir>
ninja -C <build_dir> test
```
