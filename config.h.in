// IMPORTANT:
//   Use constexpr and avoid #define whenever possible. This has the benefit of
//   compiling as much code as possible, regardless if it is actually used. Thus
//   ensuring each code path remains buildable. Note that the optimization path
//   should delete the unused code later.

// TODO: This has a problem because as currently designed, meson will replace
//       the field with `True`, which won't compile. Will need to investigate
//       later. Fortunately, this variable is not currently used. So we can
//       comment it out and leave it here for an example when other config
//       options are added later.

// IMPORTANT:
//   Avoid using #define whenever possible. See note above for reason.
